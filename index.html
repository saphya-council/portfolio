Users are also urged to visit their pet together every now and then to give their pet a love boost.</p>

					<p>For our assignment on photogrammetry, I took several photos of the service elevator and imported them into Agiscan. I was confused as to why the three-sixty rendered image was blotchy, missing the important details of the environment such as the reflection of light on the metal elevator doors and the area outside the window. Also, when exported, for some reason the 3d model lacked the textures I saw when viewing them in the photogrammetry software.</p>
					<img src="images/Screenshot (411).png" alt="Screenshot (411)"/>
					<p>Nonetheless, I wanted to see if I could somehow use what I ultimately ended up with, in my roller ball game. I imagined the elevator as a prop in a dystopian city, a product of a nuclear meltdown that destroyed civilization as we knew it. And, you (the roller ball) as a mouse navigating the ruins of the city. The combination of organic grass and artificial technology of the elevator indicates a cycle of repossession by mother nature, reclaiming her territory and emphasizing her natural superiority to manmade mechanisms.</p>

					<p>For the purpose of experimenting with the Blippar app, I decided to animate Spongebob's face:</p>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/02/22101451/SPONGEBOB_blipp-300x237.jpg" alt="SPONGEBOB_blipp"/>
					<p>By cropping three faces from this png:</p>
					<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-77549" src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/02/22102224/8472-spongebob-square-pants-spongebobs-facial-expressions-300x225.jpg" alt="8472-spongebob-square-pants-spongebobs-facial-expressions"/>

					<p>I animated a four-second gif to match the sound of Spongebob's laugh:</p>
					<img src="images/Screenshot (357).png" alt="Screenshot (357)"/>
					<p>I first tried to make the Blipp in the classic Blipbuilder, but the soundfile wasn't playing:</p>
					<img src="images/Screenshot (358).png" alt="Screenshot (358)"/>
					<p>So I made a new Blipp in the new Blipbuilder and while testing it, I discovered the sound still wasn't working.</p>
					<img src="images/Screenshot (359).png" alt="Screenshot (359)"/>
					<p>I think it has something to do with the fact that the soundfile I was using an .mp3. I reexported it as a .wav and am in the process of testing it again.</p>
					<p>Blipp code is: 436891.</p>
					<p>*Update: The Blipbuilder classic and the new Blipbuilder both produce different errors in my gif. Unfortunately I can not have a gif that plays with sound in either</p>

					<h3>Phase 1: Design and Conquer</h3>
					<p>Since I want my game to have a pixelated aesthetic, a lot of my textures were made in the style you will see below:<p>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28163113/Screenshot-262-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-262"/> 
					<p>First, it started with a flower.</p>
					<p>The game is supposed to take place in Japan. I appropriated many Japanese motifs such as the cherry blossom in the main map and sumo wrestling mat in minigame one.</p>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28163101/Screenshot-261-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-261" /> 
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28162708/Screenshot-287-286x300.png" alt="screenshot-287"/>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28163048/Screenshot-260-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-260"/>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28162718/Screenshot-288-285x300.png" alt="screenshot-288"/>
					<p>Some models aren't completely original. This coin for example, I made in Blender but the texture is from a .png I found on the interweb.</p>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28163006/Screenshot-257-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-257"/>
					<p>The picture above is the first version of my pig. I had a lot of trouble linking limbs to the pigs body through the boolean modifier so I scrapped this pig and made the one below.</p>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28162657/Screenshot-286-273x300.png" alt="screenshot-286" />
					<p>The second version of the pig also had trouble coming together, but by this point I had all the animations done and textures applied so I didn't want to make a whole other model.</p>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28162435/Screenshot-276-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-276"/>

					<h3>Phase 2: Unified in Unity</h3>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28162152/Screenshot-264-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-264"/>

					<p>My game will use spherical gravity as opposed to the regular gravity used for Unity objects. The pig needs to constantly be pulled towards the center as it moves around the spherical surface. I used the following to achieve this action:</p>

					<h3>Minigame 1:</h3>
					<p>A simple coin collecting game. Players are in a race against time in the dark as they collect coins to get the highest score in this minigame. This was by far the easiest part of the entire game, since it didn't involve scripting physics to work.</p>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28162449/Screenshot-277-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-277"/>

					<h3>Minigame 2:</h3>
					<p>Players try to stay grounded on a ever-tilting disk rotating on a pivot. One player can throw their opponents off balance by clicking on the screen, which instantiates random objects (coins or teacups) to throw the player off balance.</p>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28162728/Screenshot-289-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-289"/>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28162905/Screenshot-296-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-296"/>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28162822/Screenshot-293-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-293"/>
					<h3>Minigame 3:</h3>
					<p>Players try to remain on the spinning bottle (controlled by another player), running in the opposite direction the bottle is spinning in to avoid falling off.</p>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28162837/Screenshot-294-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-294"/>
					<br>
					<h3>Phase 3: Embellishing</h3>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28162925/Screenshot-297-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-297" />

					<p>I only used royalty-free sound for my game. I used sources such as freesound.org and Kevin Macleod's <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Kevin_MacLeod/">personal site</a> to find materials.</p>
					<img class="wp-image-66009 size-medium" src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/28212905/Screenshot-300-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-300"/> 
					<br>
					<h3>Phase 4: The Future</h3>
					<p>Besides the obvious glitches, my biggest goal for this game is to add online multiplayer support. This game is ideally for Android and iOS devices so I expect to have builds for those operating systems in the future.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Updates:</h3>
					<h3>New Minigame 4 (Hot Pigtato)!</h3>
					<p>After struggling with the physics in Minigame 2 and 3,  I've decided to create another minigame with easier mechanics as I work on troubleshooting the others. I took the disk from Minigame 2 and separated it into four objects in Blender before exporting the .fbx in Unity and making animations there. I was having too much trouble with exporting the Blender animations so I decided to forego that and try out Unity animations. I thought that animating objects in Unity was much easier than in Blender. With all the animations now done, I made an array with every piece of the disk inside, so that every five seconds, up to three pieces are randomly triggered. The objective of this minigame is to outlast the timer, and avoid the other player so you don't get pushed off the platform.</p>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/12/12141123/Screenshot-304-300x130.png" alt="screenshot-304"/></a>
					<h3>Minigame 1 - Pig Grows Larger!</h3>
					<p>With every coin, the pig is scaled up by (0.025f, 0.025f, 0.025f). Whichever pig reaches (0.7,0.7,0.7) first, wins the round.</p>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/12/12142546/Screenshot-309-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-309"/>
					<h3>Main Menu and Modes!</h3>
					<p>Instead of jumping right into the main map, players now have the option of playing story mode (main map and randomized mini games) or minigame mode where players can select whichever minigame they like best.</p>
					<img src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ima-wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/12/12141206/Screenshot-303-300x169.png" alt="screenshot-303"/></a>
					<h3>Instructions!</h3>
					<p>To help players know which pig they are playing as, and the controls for the game.</p>
